            <b>Mathematics</b> (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek">Greek</a>:<a
                href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%AC%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1#English">μάθημα</a> , máthēma,
            'knowledge, study, learning') includes the study of such topics as

            (geometry),[1] and change (analysis).[3][4][5] It has
            no
            generally accepted definition.[6][7]

        <p>Mathematicians seek and use patterns[8][9] to formulate new conjectures; they resolve the truth or falsity of
            such by
            mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, mathematical reasoning
            can
            be
            used to provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics
            developed
            from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical
            objects.
            Practical mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research
            required
            to
            solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements.[10] Since the
            pioneering
            work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), David Hilbert (1862–1943), and others on axiomatic systems in the late
            19th
            century, it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction
            from
            appropriately chosen axioms and definitions. Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the
            Renaissance,
            when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the
            rate of
            mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day.[11]

            Mathematics is essential in many fields, including natural science, engineering, medicine, finance, and the
            social
            sciences. Applied mathematics has led to entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game
            theory.
            Mathematicians engage in pure mathematics (mathematics for its own sake) without having any application in
            mind,
            but
            practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered later.[12][13]

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of abstractions. The first abstraction, which
        is shared by many animals,[14] was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and
        a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely the quantity of their members.

        As evidenced by tallies found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects, prehistoric
        peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or
        years.[15][16]
    </p>
    <p>
        Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000 BC, when the Babylonians and Egyptians
        began using arithmetic, algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and
        construction, and for astronomy.[17] The oldest mathematical texts from Mesopotamia and Egypt are from 2000 to
        1800 BC.[18] Many early texts mention Pythagorean triples and so, by inference, the Pythagorean theorem seems to
        be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.[19] It is in
        Babylonian mathematics that elementary arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) first
        appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a sexagesimal
        numeral system [19] which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.[20]
